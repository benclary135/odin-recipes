Thoughts at project start: This project is the first real test of my understanding of HTML.  By the end of this project, I should have a complete, if not basic and clunky, webpage that I have created entirely using HTML.  In addition, this wil be a chance for me to practice using good commit strategies, committing regularly and with descriptive, clean commit messages.  I currently don't have a strong grasp on git and how to use it, so this should be helpful.
